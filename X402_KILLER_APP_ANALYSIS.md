- **MEV searchers**: Scan mempool constantly
- **Arbitrage bots**: Monitor DEX prices 24/7
- **Sniping bots**: Buy new token launches instantly
- **Portfolio managers**: Rebalance positions hourly
- **Liquidation bots**: Hunt for underwater positions

### What Agents Value:
1. **Alpha generation** (make money) - Will pay $$$$
2. **Risk reduction** (don't lose money) - Will pay $$$
3. **Cost optimization** (gas, slippage) - Will pay $$
4. **Speed** (microseconds matter) - Will pay $$$

### What Agents DON'T Care About:
- Brand reputation ‚ùå
- User experience ‚ùå
- Marketing ‚ùå
- They only care: **ROI and reliability**

## Top 5 Agent Services (Ranked by Demand)

### ü•á #1: Token Launch Risk Scorer (RUG PULL DETECTOR)

**What It Does:**
- Analyzes new token launches in real-time
- Scores rug pull risk 0-100
- Checks: liquidity locked, contract verified, honeypot detection, holder concentration, dev wallet history

**Why #1:**
```
PROBLEM: Billions lost to rug pulls every year
CURRENT SOLUTIONS: Manual (RugDoc), slow (Token Sniffer)
AGENT PAIN: Sniping bots lose $10k-100k per rug pull
ROI: One saved rug = 2000+ API calls paid for
WILLINGNESS TO PAY: Very high ($2-5 per check)
```

**Target Users:**
- Token sniping bots (buy new launches instantly)
- DeFi protocols (token listing screening)
- DEX aggregators (warn users)
- Portfolio managers (avoid scams)

**Pricing:**
- **$2.00 per token analysis**
- Volume: 10,000 new tokens/day on all chains

**Why zkML Matters Here:**
- Prove WHY you flagged it (not just "trust us")
- Contract features + on-chain data = verifiable risk score
- Agents can verify the analysis was correct
- Build reputation over time (track record of caught rugs)

**JOLT Feasibility:** ‚úÖ **PERFECT FIT**

### ü•à #2: Gas Price Predictor

**What It Does:**
- Predicts optimal gas price for next block
- Estimates transaction inclusion time

**Why High Demand:**
```
PROBLEM: Agents overpay on gas (millions wasted)
CURRENT SOLUTIONS: Blocknative ($$$), EthGasStation (inaccurate)
AGENT PAIN: Either overpay or get stuck in mempool
ROI: Save 20% on gas = huge for high-frequency bots
WILLINGNESS TO PAY: Medium ($0.10-0.50 per prediction)
```

**Pricing:**
- **$0.10 per prediction**
- Volume: 1M+ transactions/day (every agent tx)
- Potential revenue: **$100k/day = $3M/month**

**JOLT Feasibility:** ‚úÖ **FITS**
```
Features (64 elements):
- current_base_fee: 1
- current_priority_fee: 1
- pending_tx_count: 1
- block_utilization: 1
- time_of_day: 1
- day_of_week: 1
- Recent gas history (50 blocks): 50
- Mempool features: 8

Total: 64 features
Output: Predicted gas price (gwei)
```

**Why zkML Matters:**
- Prove you used the model (not just guessing)
- Track accuracy over time (verifiable track record)
- Agents trust verifiable predictions more

---

### ü•â #3: Smart Contract Honeypot Detector

**What It Does:**
- Checks if token contract allows selling (or is honeypot)
- Simulates buy+sell before real transaction

**Why High Demand:**
```
PROBLEM: Honeypot tokens (can buy but can't sell)
CURRENT SOLUTIONS: Manual testing (slow), honeypot.is (not always accurate)
AGENT PAIN: Buy token, can't sell, lose 100%
ROI: One avoided honeypot = infinite ROI
WILLINGNESS TO PAY: High ($1-2 per check)
```

**Pricing:**
- **$1.00 per honeypot check**
- Volume: Same as rug detector (10k/day)
- Potential revenue: **$10k/day = $300k/month**

**JOLT Feasibility:** ‚úÖ **FITS**
```
Features (40 elements):
- Contract bytecode patterns (30 features)
- Function signatures (5 features)
- Ownership features (5 features)

Output: Honeypot probability 0-100
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ #4: DEX Route Optimizer

**What It Does:**
- Compares execution across DEXes (Uniswap, Curve, Balancer...)
- Predicts which route gives best price after slippage

**Why Medium Demand:**
```
PROBLEM: Multi-DEX routing is complex
CURRENT SOLUTIONS: 1inch, Matcha (free but not verifiable)
AGENT PAIN: Suboptimal routing = lost profit
ROI: 0.1% better execution = big on large trades
WILLINGNESS TO PAY: Medium ($0.25 per route)
```

**Pricing:**
- **$0.25 per route optimization**
- Volume: 100k swaps/day
- Potential revenue: **$25k/day = $750k/month**

**JOLT Feasibility:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **CHALLENGING**
- Need to evaluate multiple pools (could exceed 64 elements)
- Possible with approximation

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ #5: Wallet Reputation Scorer

**What It Does:**
- Scores wallet safety 0-100 based on transaction history
- Flags known scammers, phishers, exploiters

**Why Lower Demand (for agents):**
```
PROBLEM: Interacting with malicious wallets
CURRENT SOLUTIONS: Etherscan labels (limited), Chainalysis (enterprise)
AGENT PAIN: Less critical than token risk
ROI: Prevents some losses
WILLINGNESS TO PAY: Low-Medium ($0.50 per check)
```

**Pricing:**
- **$0.50 per wallet check**
- Volume: 50k checks/day
- Potential revenue: **$25k/day = $750k/month**

**JOLT Feasibility:** ‚úÖ **FITS**

- Problem getting WORSE (more new tokens daily)

**2. High Willingness to Pay**
- Agents gladly pay $2-5 if it saves $10k+ loss
- Clear ROI: 1 saved rug = 2000-5000 API calls

**3. No Good Alternative**
- RugDoc: Manual, slow
- Token Sniffer: Many false positives
- DEXTools: Basic scoring, not comprehensive
- **No one offers verifiable risk scoring**

**4. Perfect for zkML**
- 60 features fit JOLT perfectly
- Verifiable proof = trust + accountability
- Can track accuracy over time on-chain
- Build reputation: "Caught 95% of rugs in Q1 2025"

**5. Agent-Native Use Case**
- Sniping bots check EVERY new token
- DeFi protocols screen listings
- Trading bots evaluate before buying
- Portfolio managers avoid scams

**6. Recurring Revenue**
- 10,000+ new tokens launch daily (across all chains)
- Each needs risk scoring
- Agents will check repeatedly (pre-buy, pre-list, etc.)

**7. Network Effects**
- More usage = more data
- More data = better model
- Better model = more usage
- **Virtuous cycle**
