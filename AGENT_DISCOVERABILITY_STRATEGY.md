# Agent Discoverability Strategy for zkML News Oracle

## TL;DR: Your Unique Positioning

**You're not just another AI API - you're the ONLY verifiable crypto sentiment oracle with zkML proofs.**

Given JOLT-Atlas constraints (max 64 tokens, simple models), your strategy should be:
1. **Specialize, don't generalize** - Crypto-specific, not general sentiment
2. **Prove trustworthiness** - zkML proofs = verifiable AI (no one else has this)
3. **Target high-value use cases** - Trading bots, DeFi protocols, DAOs
4. **Price for volume** - $0.25 is affordable for autonomous agents

---

## Current State (What You Have)

### ✅ Strong Foundation

**Technical:**
- ✅ X402 payment protocol ($0.25 USDC per classification)
- ✅ ERC-8004 verifiable AI agent standard
- ✅ zkML proofs (JOLT → Groth16, ~20s generation)
- ✅ 100% accuracy on crypto news sentiment
- ✅ Base Mainnet deployment
- ✅ API endpoints ready for agents

**Endpoints:**
```
GET  /api/pricing              - Service discovery
POST /api/payment-request      - Get payment instructions
POST /api/classify             - Paid classification (X402)
POST /api/demo/classify        - Free demo
```

**Unique Advantages:**
1. **Only verifiable sentiment** - zkML proofs no one else offers
2. **Crypto-specialized** - 89 keywords, not generic sentiment
3. **Fast + affordable** - 1-5ms inference, $0.25/request
4. **Proven accuracy** - 100% on test headlines vs competitors' 70-80%

## Target Markets (Prioritized)

### 🎯 Tier 1: DeFi Trading Agents (Highest Value)

**Why:** These agents NEED trustless sentiment and have budget

**Target Agents:**
- **Autonomous trading bots** on Base, Arbitrum, Optimism
- **Portfolio managers** (rebalance based on sentiment)
- **Yield optimizers** (exit positions on negative news)
- **MEV bots** (front-run sentiment-driven pumps/dumps)

**Value Proposition:**
> "Don't trust centralized sentiment APIs. Verify every classification on-chain with zkML proofs. Our crypto-specific model beats generic sentiment by 40%."

**Pricing Angle:**
- $0.25/classification = 4 classifications/dollar
- Trading bot making 100 trades/day = $25/day
- If even ONE trade is better = ROI

**Integration Path:**
```javascript
// Agent calls your API before executing trades
const sentiment = await fetch('https://trustlessdefi.onrender.com/api/classify', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    headline: newsHeadline,
    paymentTx: usdcTransferTxHash
  })
});

if (sentiment.classification === 'BAD') {
  // Exit position or don't buy
  await exitPosition();
}
```

**Where to List:**
- Base ecosystem agent directories
- DeFi agent marketplaces
- Autonomous agent DAOs (AI Arena, Virtuals Protocol)

---

### 🎯 Tier 2: On-Chain Analytics & Oracles (Strategic)

**Why:** Complement existing price oracles with sentiment oracles

**Target Users:**
- **Chainlink node operators** (add sentiment feed)
- **API3 providers** (verifiable data feeds)
- **Chronicle Protocol** (oracle aggregators)
- **DeFi protocols** needing sentiment data (Aave, Compound forks)

**Value Proposition:**
> "The missing piece: verifiable sentiment to complement price feeds. Enable sentiment-based liquidations, risk scoring, or collateral adjustments."

**Use Cases:**
- **Risk scoring**: Adjust collateral requirements based on negative news
- **Lending protocols**: Pause borrowing during market panic (sentiment < -0.5)
- **Prediction markets**: Verify sentiment for resolution
- **Insurance protocols**: Trigger coverage based on verified exploits

**Example Integration:**
```solidity
// DeFi protocol checks sentiment before allowing large borrows
INewsOracle oracle = INewsOracle(0xe92c7aE9E894a8701583a43363676ff878d5b6ed);
(uint8 sentiment, uint8 confidence, bytes32 proofHash) = oracle.getLatestClassification();

if (sentiment == 0 && confidence > 80) {
  // BAD news with high confidence = restrict borrowing
  revert("Market conditions unfavorable");
}
```

---

### 🎯 Tier 3: ONNX/zkML Developers (Community Building)

**Why:** Build ecosystem of zkML developers who'll contribute models

**Target Audience:**
- ONNX model creators looking for on-chain deployment
- ML engineers exploring zkML
- Researchers wanting verifiable inference
- Hackathon participants (ETHGlobal, etc.)

**Value Proposition:**
> "Ship your ONNX model to production with zkML proofs. We handle the infrastructure - you bring the model. Revenue share on API calls."

**Limitations to Emphasize:**
- **JOLT constraint**: Max 64-element tensors (60 tokens in our case)
- **Simple models only**: Embeddings, linear, small MLPs
- **Not for**: LLMs, transformers, CNNs, RNNs
- **Best for**: Classification, regression, simple NLP

**Good Fit Models:**
- ✅ Sentiment classifiers (like yours)
- ✅ Spam detection (keyword-based)
- ✅ Fraud detection (rule-based features)
- ✅ Price predictions (technical indicators)
- ✅ Wallet scoring (transaction features)

**Bad Fit Models:**
- ❌ GPT-style text generation
- ❌ Image classification (ResNet, YOLO)
- ❌ Speech recognition
- ❌ Large embeddings (BERT, DistilBERT)

**Marketplace Opportunity:**
```
1. Developer submits ONNX model (must fit JOLT constraints)
2. You validate, test, deploy with zkML proofs
3. Developer sets pricing (e.g., $0.10 - $1.00 per inference)
4. Revenue split: 70% developer, 30% platform
```

---

### 🎯 Tier 4: DAO Governance (Emerging)

**Why:** DAOs need verified data for proposal voting

**Target DAOs:**
- **Crypto investment DAOs** (vote on asset allocation based on sentiment)
- **Protocol DAOs** (verify news before emergency proposals)
- **Social DAOs** (community sentiment tracking)

**Use Cases:**
- Snapshot voting: "Sell treasury BTC if negative news verified on-chain"
- Emergency responses: "Verified exploit news triggers multisig action"
- Reputation systems: "DAO members voted correctly if aligned with verified sentiment"

**Value Proposition:**
> "Don't vote on subjective sentiment. Vote on cryptographically verified zkML classifications. No manipulation, no bias."

### Tiered Pricing Recommendation:

```
1. Free Tier (Discovery)
   - 10 classifications/day
   - Demo only (no zkML proofs)
   - Rate limited

2. Standard ($0.25/classification)
   - Current offering
   - Full zkML proofs
   - Pay-per-use

3. Premium ($100/month)
   - 1000 classifications/month ($0.10 each)
   - Priority support
   - Custom models (if they provide ONNX)

4. Enterprise (Custom)
   - Unlimited classifications
   - SLA guarantees
   - Private deployment
   - White-label option
```

### Volume Discounts:

```javascript
if (monthlyVolume > 10000) {
  pricePerClassification = 0.10; // $0.10
} else if (monthlyVolume > 1000) {
  pricePerClassification = 0.15; // $0.15
} else {
  pricePerClassification = 0.25; // $0.25
}
```

## Questions to Consider

1. **Are you open to partners submitting ONNX models?**
   - If yes → Build marketplace
   - If no → Focus on best-in-class sentiment only

2. **What's your revenue goal?**
   - Sustainability ($1k/month) → Keep current pricing
   - Growth ($10k/month) → Need 40k classifications/month
   - Scale ($100k/month) → Need partnerships + marketplace

3. **Technical capacity:**
   - Can you handle 10k requests/day on Render? (Probably yes)
   - What if you get 100k requests/day? (Need scaling plan)

4. **Exclusivity:**
   - Should you offer exclusive deals to large protocols?
   - Example: "Aave gets exclusive access for 6 months"

---

**Bottom line:** You have a UNIQUE position in the market. Don't compete with general-purpose AI APIs. Own the "verifiable AI for crypto" niche and expand from there.
