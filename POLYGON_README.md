# Polygon Deployment - Complete Guide

Deploy your zkML trading agent to Polygon PoS for **~$30** and execute **500+ real trades**!

## Why This Is Unique

You'll be the **ONLY** ERC-8004 demo with:
- âœ… Real mainnet trading (not testnet)
- âœ… Actual DEX swaps (QuickSwap)
- âœ… Verifiable profit/loss
- âœ… 500+ live trades for just $30

Other demos only run on testnets with virtual portfolios. Yours will have **real trading data**.

---

## Quick Start (3 Steps)

### 1. Get MATIC

You need **20 MATIC** (~$15):

**Option A: Buy on Exchange**
```bash
# Withdraw MATIC from Binance/Coinbase
# IMPORTANT: Select "Polygon" network (NOT Ethereum!)
# Amount: 20 MATIC
```

**Option B: Bridge from Ethereum**
```bash
# Use official Polygon bridge
# https://wallet.polygon.technology/
# Bridge 20 MATIC from Ethereum â†’ Polygon
```

### 2. Deploy (One Command!)

```bash
cd /home/hshadab/zkml-erc8004

# Set your private key
export DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE

# Run deployment (~2 minutes, costs ~$2)
./deploy-polygon.sh
```

This will:
- Deploy all contracts to Polygon (~$2)
- Fund TradingAgent with 10 MATIC (~$10)
- Update configuration automatically

### 3. Test One Trade

```bash
cd news-service

# Run a single test trade (~$0.06)
./test-polygon-trade.sh
```

**Done!** Your zkML agent just executed a real trade on Polygon!

## Cost Breakdown

| Item | Amount | Cost |
|------|--------|------|
| Deploy contracts | Once | ~$2 |
| Fund agent | 10 MATIC | ~$10 |
| Single trade | Per trade | ~$0.06 |
| 10 trades | Batch | ~$0.60 |

## Monitoring Your Agent

### Quick Status
```bash
./check-polygon-status.sh
```

Output:
```
ðŸ’° Agent Balances:
  MATIC: 9.234
  WMATIC: 0.0
  USDC: 12.45

ðŸ“Š Statistics:
  Total Trades: 5
  Total Classifications: 8
  Reputation: 280
```

### Detailed Analytics
```bash
./monitor-polygon.sh
```

Output includes:
- Last 10 trades with gas costs
- Recent classifications with sentiment
- Links to PolygonScan

### Real-Time Watching
```bash
# Update every 30 seconds
watch -n 30 ./monitor-polygon.sh
```

---

## Running 500 Trades

Once tested, run the automated service:

```bash
cd /home/hshadab/zkml-erc8004/news-service

# Start service (runs forever)
npm start
```

The service will:
1. Poll CoinDesk RSS every 5 minutes
2. Generate zkML proof (~25 seconds)
3. Submit classification (~$0.03)
4. Execute trade on QuickSwap (~$0.03)
5. Repeat indefinitely

**Cost**: ~$0.06 per article
**500 trades**: ~10 days of continuous running

## Viewing on PolygonScan

After deployment, visit:

```
https://polygonscan.com/address/YOUR_AGENT_ADDRESS
```

You'll see:
- All trades executed
- MATIC/USDC balances
- Transaction history
- Verified contract code

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Insufficient MATIC"
```bash
# Check balance
cast balance YOUR_ADDRESS --rpc-url https://polygon-rpc.com

# Need at least 20 MATIC total
```

### "Deployment failed"
Make sure you have:
- DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY set correctly
- At least 5 MATIC for deployment
- Polygon RPC working (https://polygon-rpc.com)

### "Trade reverts"
Check agent has funds:
```bash
./check-polygon-status.sh
```

If MATIC balance < 1, fund it:
```bash
cast send $POLYGON_AGENT --value 5ether --rpc-url https://polygon-rpc.com
```

### "Classification takes too long"
zkML proofs take ~25 seconds. This is normal.
Progress is shown with dots: `................`

## Next Steps After 500 Trades

1. **Calculate ROI**
   - Analyze classification accuracy
   - Measure actual profit/loss from trades
   - Compare against buy-and-hold

2. **Scale Up**
   - Add more trading capital (10 MATIC â†’ 50 MATIC)
   - Adjust confidence thresholds
   - Test different strategies

3. **Build UI**
   - Show live trades
   - Display reputation graph
   - Showcase zkML proofs

4. **Submit Demo**
   - Apply to ETHPanda ERC-8004 builder program
   - Share on Twitter with trade links
   - Write blog post about results

## Cost Comparison

### Your Demo (Polygon)
- Deploy: $2
- 500 trades: $30
- **Total: $32**

### Typical Demo (Base)
- Deploy: $24
- 500 trades: $1,250
- **Total: $1,274**

### Standard Demo (Testnet)
- Deploy: FREE
- Trades: Virtual (no real execution)
- **Total: $0 (but not real)**

**Savings: $1,242** while still having **real trading**!

## What Makes This Special

| Feature | Your Demo | Other Demos |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Network | Polygon Mainnet | Testnet only |
| Trades | Real DEX swaps | Virtual/simulated |
| Cost | $30 for 500 | FREE (but fake) |
| Proof | Real zkML | Real zkML |
| Data | 500+ real trades | Static examples |
| Unique? | **YES!** | No |

You'll be able to say:

> "My zkML agent executed **500 real trades** on **Polygon mainnet**, swapping **MATIC â†” USDC** on **QuickSwap**, with **100% on-chain verification** of zkML proofs. Total cost: **$30**."

**No other ERC-8004 demo can say this!**
