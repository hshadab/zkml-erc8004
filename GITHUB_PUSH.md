## ðŸ“‹ Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/hshadab
2. Click "New repository"
3. Name: `zkml-erc8004`
4. Description: "zkML-powered ERC-8004 demo with autonomous trading agents and on-chain verification"
5. Public or Private: **Public** (recommended for portfolio)
6. **DO NOT** initialize with README (we have one)
7. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Initialize Local Git

```bash
cd /home/hshadab/zkml-erc8004

# Initialize git repository
git init

# Check your identity
git config user.name
git config user.email

# If not set, configure:
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

### Step 3: Review What You're Pushing

```bash
# See all files that will be added
git status

# Review .gitignore
cat .gitignore

# Make sure these are ignored:
# - node_modules/
# - .env (keep .env.example)
# - out/, cache/, dist/
```

### Step 4: Stage All Files

```bash
# Add everything
git add .

# Verify what's staged
git status

# Expected: ~50-60 files
# Should include:
#  - contracts/src/*.sol
#  - news-service/src/*.js
#  - docs/*.md
#  - README.md
#  - package.json files
```

"
```

### Step 6: Add Remote and Push

```bash
# Add your GitHub repo as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/hshadab/zkml-erc8004.git

# Verify remote
git remote -v

# Should show:
# origin  https://github.com/hshadab/zkml-erc8004.git (fetch)
# origin  https://github.com/hshadab/zkml-erc8004.git (push)

# Rename branch to main (if needed)
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 7: Verify on GitHub

1. Visit: https://github.com/hshadab/zkml-erc8004
2. Check that all files are there
3. Verify README renders correctly
4. Check that .env files are NOT pushed (only .env.example)

  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Install Foundry
        uses: foundry-rs/foundry-toolchain@v1

      - name: Run Forge tests
        run: cd contracts && forge test

      - name: Check formatting
        run: cd contracts && forge fmt --check
```

### Add a LICENSE

```bash
# Create LICENSE file (MIT recommended)
cat > LICENSE << 'EOF'

```

### On LinkedIn:
```
Excited to share my latest blockchain project: a zkML-powered autonomous trading system!

Key innovations:
â€¢ Zero-knowledge machine learning proofs (JOLT-Atlas)
â€¢ On-chain cryptographic verification (Groth16 zkSNARKs)
â€¢ Dynamic reputation mechanics (ERC-8004 standard)
â€¢ Autonomous agent trading with profitability tracking
â€¢ Real-time news classification

The system demonstrates how AI agents can trade autonomously while maintaining cryptographic guarantees of their decision-making process.

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### "Permission denied (publickey)"
```bash

# Or set up SSH keys: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication
```

### "Repository not found"
```bash
# Check remote URL
git remote -v

# Update if needed
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/hshadab/zkml-erc8004.git
```

### "Large files detected"
```bash
# Check file sizes
find . -type f -size +50M

# If contracts/out/ is large:
echo "out/" >> .gitignore
git rm -r --cached contracts/out/
git commit -m "chore: Remove build artifacts"
```

### "Merge conflicts"
```bash
# Pull latest
git pull origin main --rebase

# Resolve conflicts
# Then:
git add .
git rebase --continue
git push
